Conflict, from interpersonal disputes to\narmed conflicts between states, has always been an inherent part of\nhuman civilization at some level. This is especially relevant today, as\nrecent world events serve as an extremely unpleasant reminder of the\ntragic destruction of human life and livelihood due to armed conflicts.\nThis project aims to analyze historical data on armed and violent\nconflicts in the time period from 1946 - 2020.\nData source\nThis project uses the Uppsala Conflict Data Program’s (UCDP) Dyadic\nDataset, a project within the UCDP at the Department of Peace and\nConflict Research, Uppsala University. The UCDP Dyadic dataset builds on\nthe UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset, by focusing on individual dyads\nwithin each conflict. For the purpose of data collection, state-based\narmed conflict is defined as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns\ngovernment and/or territory where the use of armed force between two\nparties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in\nat least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year”\nData downloads - Pettersson, Therese (2021) UCDP Dyadic Dataset\nCodebook v 21.1 (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)\n\n\n\n",
